                    Step 1
                
                
                    Line a large deep-sided baking tray with baking paper. Whisk coconut milk, evaporated milk and condensed milk in a large bowl until combined. Place the cakes side-by-side in lined tray. Prick all over with a skewer. Pour half the milk mixture evenly over the cakes. Carefully turn the cakes. Prick all over. Pour over the remaining milk mixture. Set aside for 10 mins to soak.
                
                            
                                                                    
                
                    
    
    
                    Step 2
                
                
                    Meanwhile, use an electric mixer to whisk the cream, sour cream and icing sugar in a medium bowl until soft peaks form. Add the lemon curd and use a round-bladed knife to marble.
                
                            
                                                                                                
                
                    
    
    
                    Step 3
                
                
                    Transfer 1 cake to a serving plate. Spoon over half the cream mixture. Top with remaining cake, reserving any milk mixture in tray. Spoon over remaining cream mixture. Top with flaked coconut. Drizzle with reserved milk mixture.
